### _SOFTWARE APPLICATION DESIGN_
-----------
**The task of designing a software application includes the development for each individual variant of the functions of accumulation and maintenance of information, a given structure, in a file on disk.
When designing an application, make up the following functions:**

1. Functions that serve working with a file created in the mode.bin:
    - writing information to the end of the file;
    - view the entire file;
    - viewing a separate record by its specified number;
    - Mark an entry for deletion
    - Uncheck the record for deletion
    - deleting entries from a file marked in the delete labels field.
    - Output the help specified in the task
      
2. A function that solves a computational problem. This function, in turn, NEEDS to be broken down into simpler functions based on a given algorithm for solving a computational problem and implementing certain computational procedures of the computational problem.
Information for solving the problem should be accumulated in the file as it becomes available.

4. Develop the program interface. The menu should use all the features,

_The Literary Institute has commissioned a program to monitor student progress for the Dean's office. In the dean's offices of the Institute, the following information is stored in the file for each student: course number, group number, full name, grades for 4 exams. The information in the file is not sorted. Display a certificate on the screen about the top three (by average score) students of a given course._
